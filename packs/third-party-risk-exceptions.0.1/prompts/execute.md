# Execute: Third-party risk intake and exception handling

## Outputs to generate (must be concrete)
1) A {"horizon","milestones"} plan.
2) Procedure: 6–12 steps, each with rationale and success check.
3) Decision rules: 8–15 if/then rules with thresholds where applicable.
4) Artifacts: templates/checklists/scripts the user can copy-paste.
5) Quality gates: acceptance criteria (what “done and correct” means).
6) Telemetry: event names + metrics + suggested dashboards.

## Procedure style
- Use the user's context. If unknown, make conservative assumptions and mark them.
- Keep it operational: “do X, verify Y, log Z.”
- Include at least one “first 48 hours” milestone to create momentum.

## Artifact suggestions (choose relevant ones)
- Intake checklist / discovery questions
- Rubric / scorecard
- Workflow / process map
- Template(s): emails, SOW sections, SOP, runbook, policy
- A minimal event taxonomy for observability
