# Valiate: Deal desk approvals and non-standard contract terms triage

## Validation checklist
- [ ] Required context present or assumptions clearly labeled
- [ ] Procedure has success checks and is feasible under constraints
- [ ] Decision rules are testable (include thresholds where possible)
- [ ] Artifacts are copy-pastable and match the procedure
- [ ] Quality gates can be evaluated by a human reviewer
- [ ] Telemetry events + metrics map to the objective

## Common failure modes to guard against
- Over-scoping (too big to validate quickly)
- Vague deliverables (no artifacts)
- No measurement plan (can’t tell if it worked)
